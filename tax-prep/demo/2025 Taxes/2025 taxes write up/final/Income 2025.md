## Income by Source (Annual Totals)

| Source | Type | Annual Total | Status |
|--------|------|-------------|--------|
| TechStart Inc. | Contract (Gusto payroll) | $114,000.00 | Confirmed — matches 1099-NEC |
| GreenLeaf Design Co. | Contract (ACH transfers) | $36,500.00 | ASK CPA (see below) |
| Stripe | Freelance/project payments | $6,800.00 | Confirmed — no 1099 expected (under $600/client threshold) |

## 1099 Cross-Reference

| Payer | 1099 Type | 1099 Amount | Bank Deposits | Status |
|-------|-----------|-------------|---------------|--------|
| TechStart Inc. | 1099-NEC | $114,000.00 | $114,000.00 | Confirmed Match |
| GreenLeaf Design Co. | 1099-NEC | $28,000.00 | $36,500.00 | ASK CPA |

> **ASK CPA**: Verify total GreenLeaf income. Bank deposits show $36,500 (Feb $8,500 + May $12,000 + Jun $7,500 + Oct $8,500) but 1099-NEC on file shows $28,000. Discrepancy of $8,500. May receive corrected 1099. CPA should verify directly with GreenLeaf Design Co. and cross-reference against invoices and bank deposit records.

## Notes

- All TechStart income arrives as Gusto payroll deposits on the 1st or 2nd of each month
- GreenLeaf payments are project-based and irregular
- Stripe payouts represent multiple small client projects
- Total bank deposits: $157,300.00
- Interest income: $847.23
- Total reportable income: $157,300.00 (business) + $847.23 (interest) = $158,147.23
- The $847.23 interest is passive income (1099-INT), not Schedule C business income
