## Notes

- State taxes: Colorado Q1–Q2, then Oregon Q3–Q4 due to mid-year move (Denver to Portland, August/September 2025).
- Q4 payment was made January 15, 2026 but applies to tax year 2025.
- All payments confirmed with receipt/confirmation numbers.
- Q1–Q2 payments also appear as excluded items in business checking account (see Expenses file, Excluded Items section).
