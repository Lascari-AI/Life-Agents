## Cross-Reference with 1099s

- **TechStart 1099-NEC**: $114,000.00 — matches bank deposits exactly
- **GreenLeaf 1099-NEC**: $28,000.00 on file, but bank deposits show $36,500.00
  - ? **Discrepancy of $8,500.00** — the October deposit ($8,500) may have been for 2025 work but 1099 was prepared before that payment was processed. ASK CPA: Verify total GreenLeaf income. May receive corrected 1099 or need to report full $36,500.
- **Stripe**: $6,800 in payouts — no 1099 on file (below reporting threshold). Still reportable income.

## Notes

- All TechStart income arrives as Gusto payroll deposits on the 1st or 2nd of each month
- GreenLeaf payments are project-based and irregular
- Stripe payouts represent multiple small client projects
- Total reportable business income: $157,300.00 (bank deposits) + $847.23 (interest) = $158,147.23
- NOTE: The $847.23 interest is passive income, not Schedule C
