## Special Considerations
<!-- STATUS: complete -->

### Mid-Year Move (Denver → Portland)
- Moved September 1, 2025 from Denver, CO to Portland, OR
- Affects state tax filing (part-year resident for both CO and OR)
- Affects home office deduction (two different calculations)
- Affects utility/internet providers and amounts

### Business Travel — GreenLeaf Client Trip
- Trip to Miami in June 2025 for GreenLeaf Co. client work
- Business expenses to look for on Chase business checking: flight, hotel, meals, Uber/rideshare

### Equipment Purchase
- New MacBook Pro purchased in January 2025 — $2,499
- 100% business use
- Look for this on Chase business checking
- May qualify for Section 179 or bonus depreciation

### Coworking Space
- WeWork coworking space used October–November 2025 in Portland
- Used while home office was being set up after the move
- Look for WeWork charges on Chase business checking

### ASK CPA
- **Moving Expenses**: Should the moving expenses from Denver to Portland be deductible? Moved for personal reasons, not employer-required. (Note: Federal moving deduction is generally suspended under TCJA for non-military, but state treatment may differ.)
- **Part-Year State Returns**: Colorado part-year resident return needed in addition to Oregon? (Likely yes — need to confirm filing requirements for both states.)
