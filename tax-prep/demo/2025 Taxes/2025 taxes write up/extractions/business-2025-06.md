## Flagged Items

1. **SOUTHWEST AIR 5263847 — $487.50 (2025-06-05)**
   Flight booking with no destination or itinerary details on statement. Need boarding pass or itinerary confirmation to verify this was a business trip (likely Miami based on subsequent hotel charge). Confirm business purpose.

2. **STK STEAKHOUSE MIAMI — $312.00 (2025-06-19)**
   Restaurant charge during Miami trip. Amount suggests a multi-person dinner. Need to confirm this was a client dinner or business meal — if so, document attendees and business purpose for deduction. Meals are subject to 50% limitation.

3. **UBER *TRIP — $65.00 (2025-06-19)**
   Generic Uber charge with no trip details. Another Uber charge on 2025-06-20 specifies Miami and appears business-related. This one lacks location context — need to verify it was part of the Miami business trip and not personal.
