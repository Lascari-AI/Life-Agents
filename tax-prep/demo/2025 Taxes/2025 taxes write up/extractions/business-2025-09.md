## Notes

- Q3 state estimated tax paid to Oregon Department of Revenue (OR DOR) instead of Colorado. This reflects the client's relocation from Colorado to Oregon during the summer.
- Portland Business License and Oregon Secretary of State LLC registration fees are consistent with establishing the business in Oregon starting Q3.
