# Life Agents

A collection of agent systems I've built and use in my own life.

Each agent is a self-contained folder you open with your coding agent of choice.
- Skills currently packaged to work directly with Claude Code

The agent's skills and commands guide you through the task step by step. 

Use more compute.

## Available Agents

| Agent | What It Does |
|-------|-------------|
| [tax-prep](tax-prep/) | Organize your self-employment finances for tax season |

## Prerequisites

- [Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) installed and configured

## Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lascari-AI/Life-Agents.git
cd life-agents
```

Then either open the agent folder you want to use:

```bash
cd tax-prep
claude
```

Or copy the `.claude/` folder from the agent into whatever directory you want to work from — no need to move your files in.

Each agent's README has detailed setup and usage instructions.
